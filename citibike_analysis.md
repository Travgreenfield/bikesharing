# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

*What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?*

The most recent population data available for the city of Des Moines (2019 Census) is 214,237 up from 204,220 in 2010.

Comparatively, New York City has a population of 8,336,817 up from 8,105,031 in 2010.

Population itself is likely going to have an affect on the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program. However, it doesn't appear to be the main factor. Over the course of analysis, I plan to demonstrate that relative size of a younger population along with an existing bike culture would make Des Moines a viable target for expansion.

### Population Comparison
The open story piece demonstrates the current population disparities between the two cities. As highlighted by the side-by-side bar graphs, the differences are quite extreme. That has held true over the last 9 years.

Additionally, a similar trend holds true in population density itself. This is an initial concern. However, as demonstrated by the population by density map, Des Moines population density varies wildly based on the zip code -- an disparity that isn't the case for our New York City analysis. This information allows a more targeted approach for initial investment.

### Growth of Youth Business
Highlighted by the "Average Trip Duration by Age" chart, the distance per ride rises for younger users. This is good news for a potential Des Moines expansion which has a higher percentage of under 18 residents than New York. As those residents age into viable customers, Des Moines offers us a built in customer base that we know are more prominent users of bike-sharing.

### An Existing Bike Culture
This is a huge deal as one of the largest barriers of entry into this space would be a culture that didn't allow for easy bike riding. That isn't the case in Des Moines which has a burgeoning biking community. Along with existing cyclists comes bike lanes, restaurants and businesses friendly to cycling commuters, and a city infrastructure that allows for safe bike riding.
